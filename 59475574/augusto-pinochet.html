                    The US helped to overthrow Allende, a well-known Marxist leader backed by the repressive Soviet
                    Regime and Fidel Castro. But at what cost? More deaths and repression would continue to ensue under
                    Pinochet, followed by a mass purge of supposed left-wing supporters.

                    The period of Pinochet’s regime was one of brutal repression and political persecution. In just a
                    few months of his presidency, thousands of Chileans were captured and held in the national stadium,
                    where many were executed. It is said that thousands of soldiers, military leaders, and civilians
                    were killed or ‘disappeared’ during Pinochet’s dictatorship.

                <blockquote>
                    "After his rise to power, Pinochet persecuted leftists, socialists, and political critics, resulting
                    in the executions of from 1,200 to 3,200 people, the internment of as many as 80,000 people, and the
                    torture of tens of thousands."

                    “In August 1987 the Pinochet government imposed an extraordinarily repressive labor code that bars
                    trade unions from political activity and requires sworn statements from union leaders that they do
                    not belong to any political party. Collective bargaining is limited to the single work site,
                    preventing effective company-wide or industry-wide bargaining. A strike may last only 60 days, at
                    which time workers must accept the employer's last offer or abandon their jobs.”

                    but we didn’t
                    get to say publicly that we were in opposition to the Pinochet dictatorship even, in fact, we were.
                    We had to
                    issue every submission to the government in advance, so it was prior censorship. We were forbidden
                    to write
                    about Chile itself - kind of funny right.

                    <br><br>
                    It was international news, basically. We reported on Brazil, Jimmy
                    Carter’s election, and his emphasis on human rights, the Palestine struggle, Africa - we tried to
                    provide news
                    in-depth about international stories that were parallel to issues important in Chile. We would write
                    about “The

                    didn’t arrest us. Especially in the airport, it was scary, because we were smuggling tapes of people

                    that anti-Allende and conservative women were principal social actors against this sort of political
                    drama. The right was more astute and able to organize and mobilize women than the left was. You can
                    see that the election of 1973, the majority of women voted against Allende. In the United States,
                    women tended to be more progressive, but in Chile, it was the opposite. The men were more
                    progressive and the women were more conservative.”
