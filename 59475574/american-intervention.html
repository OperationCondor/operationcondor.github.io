                    In a cable sent shortly after the killings, an FBI officer wrote: 'Operation Condor is the code
                    name for the collection, exchange and storage of intelligence data concerning leftists, communists
                    and Marxists which was recently established between the cooperating services in South America.' The
                    note went on to mention 'a more secret phase' of Condor, which 'involves the formation of special
                    teams from member countries who are to travel anywhere in the world to carry out sanctions,
                    [including] assassinations.'

                    On September 11, 1973, the La Moneda Presidential Palace was bombed by the CIA-backed Chilean Air
                    Force, killing Allende. Official reports claimed it was a suicide, though it was largely believed he
                    was executed with an AK-47.

                    I was in Santiago when [the coup] happened. From my house I heard the broadcast from President
                    Allende, I recorded it on my [tape recorder] actually. My friends and I took a 40-minute walk into
                    the area of town that we knew would still be controlled by the Allende government which was the
                    working class area thinking that there would be resistance to the coup here. It was clear that the
                    people were evacuating the factories and workers that we talked to said they didn’t have weapons,
                    they couldn’t resist, people were going home.
                    <br><br>
                    We saw military trucks going by with soldiers in them.
                    We thought the wise thing to do was to turn around and go back home. We went up on the balcony of
                    the house and looked into the center of town and the bombing started. We could see the smoke from
                    the burning palace from our house.

                    orchestrated by the Chilean military. The presidential palace, known as La Moneda, is bombed repeatedly.
                    By the end of the day, Allende is dead and Augusto Pinochet appoints himself President.
